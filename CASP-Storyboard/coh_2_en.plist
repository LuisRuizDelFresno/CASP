	<string>How to use this appraisal tool
Three broad issues need to be considered when appraising a cohort study:
- Are the results of the trial valid?      (Section A)
- What are the results?      (Section B)
- Will the results help locally?      (Section C)
The 12 questions on the following pages are designed to help you think about these issues systematically.
The first two questions are screening questions and can be answered quickly. If the answer to both is “yes”, it is worth proceeding with the remainig questions.

There is some degree of overlap between the questions, you are asked to record a “yes”, “no” or “can’t tell” to most of the questions. A number of italicised prompts are given after each question. These are designed to remind you why the question is important. Record your reasons for your answers in the spaces provided.

There will not be time in the small groups to answer them all in detail!</string>

					<key>pista</key>
					<string>A question can be focused in terms of
- The population studied
- The risk factors studied
- The outcomes considered
- Is it clear whether the study tried to detect a beneficial or harmful effect?</string>

					<key>pista</key>
					<string>We are looking for selection bias which might compromise the generalisability of the findings:
- Was the cohort representative of a defined population?
- Was there something special about the cohort?
- Was everybody included who should have been included?</string>

					<key>pista</key>
					<string>Look for measurement or classification bias:
- Did they use subjective or objective measurements?

					<string>Look for measurement or classification bias:
- Did they use subjective or objective measurements?
- Do the measures truly reflect what you want them to (have they been validated)?
- Has a reliable system been established for detecting all the cases (for measuring disease occurrence)?
- Were the measurement methods similar in the different groups?
- Were the subjects and/or the outcome assessor blinded to exposure (does this matter)?</string>

					<key>pista</key>

					<key>pista</key>
					<string>- The good or bad effects should have had long enough to reveal themselves
- The persons that are lost to follow-up may have different outcomes than those available for assessment
- In an open or dynamic cohort, was there anything special about the outcome of the people leaving, or the exposure of the people entering the cohort?</string>

					<string>One observational study rarely provides sufficiently robust evidence to recommend changes to clinical practice or within health policy decision making.
