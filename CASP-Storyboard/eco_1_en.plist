- Remember the perspective being taken.
Measured accurately in appropriate units prior to evaluation?
- Appropriate units may be hours of nursing time, number of physician visits, years-of-life gained etc.
Valued credibly?
- Are the values realistic?
- How have they been derived?
- Have opportunity costs been considered?</string>
