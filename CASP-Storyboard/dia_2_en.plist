	<string>How to use this appraisal tool
Three broad issues need to be considered when appraising a diagnostic test:
- Are the results of the trial valid?      (Section A)
- What are the results?      (Section B)
- Will the results help locally?      (Section C)
The 12 questions on the following pages are designed to help you think about these issues systematically.
The first two questions are screening questions and can be answered quickly. If the answer to both is “yes”, it is worth proceeding with the remainig questions.

There is some degree of overlap between the questions, you are asked to record a “yes”, “no” or “can’t tell” to most of the questions. A number of italicised prompts are given after each question. These are designed to remind you why the question is important. Record your reasons for your answers in the spaces provided.

There will not be time in the small groups to answer them all in detail!

The 12 questions are adapted from: Jaesche R, Guyatt GH, Sackett DL, Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature, V1. How to use an article about a diagnostic test. JAMA 1994; 271 (5): 389-391</string>
