		<string>&lt;b&gt;Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI): &lt;/b&gt;The ABI is the absolute arithmetic difference in event rates of a desired positive outcome. This can be calculated by subtracting the Control Event Rate from the Experimental Event Rate. An absolute benefit increase is found when the experimental intervention does more good than the control.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Accuracy (of a test): &lt;/b&gt;Is how good a test is at identifying whether a person has a condition.

Accuracy is not the only feature of a test we may need to evaluate. We can also assess repeatability (see below) and the impact of a test when used in combination with an appropriate treatment on a patient outcome like cure rate or survival (effectiveness).</string>

Cohort studies are therefore useful when attempting to answer a question of a prognostic or aetiological nature. The researcher conducting the study, however, may begin the study at any time, as long as all the baseline information about the patients was collected during a specified time period and exposure status was determined before the outcomes were measured. </string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Confidence Interval (CI): &lt;/b&gt;The CI is the range within which we would expect the true value of a statistical measure to lie (never exactly known). It is usually accompanied by a percentage value that shows the level of confidence that the true value lies within. For example, for a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10, with a 95% CI of 5 to 15, we would have 95% confidence that the true NNT value was between 5 and 15. When displayed in a graphical format, confidence intervals look like the following figure.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;CI@2x.png&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here we have five odds ratios (the blue squares), each with a 95% confidence interval around them (the horizontal line). Each odds ratio represents the results of a single randomised controlled trial (RCT). The blue shape on each CI shows the most likely value of the result, with the horizontal line showing the 95% confidence interval. When this horizontal line crosses the central vertical line, the result can be deemed to have no statistical significance. The lozenge shaped blob at the bottom represents the pooled and weighted results of the five RCT’s. In this case we have two individual trials that are not significant. However, when we combine the results of all five trials, we can see that the result is statistically significant.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Heterogeneity: &lt;/b&gt;Studies in a systematic review are said to be heterogeneous if they differ in some way that could lead to them having different results e.g. the study design, the period or country where they were conducted, the intervention used etc. In meta-analysis, heterogeneity occurs when there is more variation between the study results (in a meta-analysis) than would be expected by chance alone. Heterogeneity can be assessed by looking at the odds ratio diagram. The examples show the results of a meta-analysis, which has heterogeneous results (Figure 1).
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Heterogeneity1@2x.png&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;display:block;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Figure 2 a vertical red line has been drawn to intersect all of the 95% confidence intervals. One of the trials (marked A) is to the left of this line, and the results can therefore be judged heterogeneous. The opposite of heterogeneity is homogeneity.

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve): &lt;/b&gt;A graph used when a test can have different cut-off values (“thresholds”) to define positive and negative results. Traditionally sensitivity is plotted on the vertical axis and 1-specificity on the horizontal one. One point is used to represent the sensitivity and specificity pair for each threshold. The points are joined to create a curve; the closer the curve is to the left and the top of the graph, the better the accuracy.</string>

		<string>&lt;b&gt;Stratification: &lt;/b&gt;Stratification or stratified randomisation is a method for controlling for confounding factors in an RCT. By this method, the study participants are divided into homogeneous categories or “strata” where they all share the same characteristic of interest - the potentially confounding variable e.g. gender, age and diagnosis. The process of randomisation occurs within each “strata” and the final study arms are the product of each separate randomisation. For instance if age was the potentially confounding variable in a study, the participants could be divided into age groups (e.g. 20 – 40, 41 – 60, 61 and over) and randomised within each age group. The final study arms would be composed of participants from each of these separate randomisations and there would be an equal number of patients of each age group in each of the study arms. Separate analyses could be conducted in each “strata” as they had been randomised separately. </string>
