				<string>We are looking for selection bias which might compromise validity of the findings:

- Were the cases representative of a defined population (geographically and/or temporally)?
- Was there an established reliable system for selecting all the cases?
- Are they incident or prevalent?
- Is there something special about the cases?
- Is the time frame of the study relevant to disease/exposure?
- Was there a sufficient number of cases selected?

				<string>We are looking for measurement, recall or classification bias:
- Was the exposure clearly defined and accurately measured?
- Did the authors use subjective or objective measurements?
- Do the measures truly reflect what they are supposed to measure? (have they been validated?)
- Were the measurement methods similar in the cases and controls?
- Did the study incorporate blinding where feasible?
- Is the temporal relation correct? (does the exposure of interest precede the outcome?)</string>

				<key>pista</key>
				<string>Consider all the available evidence from RCTs, systematic reviews, cohort studies and case-control studies as well for consistency. One observational study rarely provides sufficiently robust evidence to recommend changes to clinical practice or within health policy decision making.
However, for certain questions observational studies provide the only evidence. Recommendations from observational studies are always stronger when supported by other evidence.</string>
